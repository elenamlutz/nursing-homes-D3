# For-profit ownership and poor care

Using [data](https://data.medicare.gov/data/nursing-home-compare) from from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, I was able to analyze complaints and deficiencies per capita filed against for-profit and non-profit owned facilites in all 50 states. Since nursing homes are increasingly owned by for-profit chains and private equity investors, I scraped the CMS website to get the latest ownership structure for each facility in the country. I used Python (pandas) to clean and analyze the dataset after merging the complaints and deficiencies for facilities with my ownership dataset.

My visualizations explain the large discrepancy of care between for-profit and non-profit or government-owned facilities. Given that for-profits own the majority of nursing homes across 50 states, I did a per-capita analysis to make sure that complaints and deficiencies are still filed mostly against for-profit owned facilities. In the top 10 worst states in terms of staffing, according to CMS five-star rankings, complaints filed per capita against for-profit facilities are higher than those against non-profit or government owned institutions.

California, North Carolina and Oklahoma have the largest difference between complaints filed against the two ownership structures.

Studies have shown that for-profit ownership exacerbates poor staffing as corporations are eager to run facilities on a leaner budget. Facilities are understaffed while nurses are underpaid.

When nurses aren't able to attend the needs of vulnerable elderly residents, deficient care is the main repercussion. Residents fall, they are not administered proper medicine or they are not given proper care. States have more deficiencies per capita filed against for-profit facilities, according to my analysis, proving how for-profit corporations can be connected to substandard care.
