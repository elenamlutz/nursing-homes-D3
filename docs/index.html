<div class="story-body"> <p>For-profit corporations own the majority of nursing home facilities in 44 states. In 2012, public health experts published a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3447240/">study</a> that concluded that the top 10 for-profit chains had less registered nurses and lower total nurse staffing hours than non-profit or government-owned facilities. The chains received 36% higher deficiencies and 41% higher serious deficiencies than government facilities.</p> <p>Using data from from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, I was able to analyze complaints and deficiencies per capita filed against for-profit and non-profit-owned facilites in all 50 states. Since nursing homes are increasingly owned by for-profit chains and private equity investors, I scraped the CMS website to get the latest ownership structure for each facility in the country. I used Python (pandas) to clean and analyze the dataset after merging the complaints and deficiencies per facility with my ownership dataset.</p>  <p>I found that 82% of complaints filed by elderly residents and family members are filed against for-profit nursing homes. Over 360,000 deficiencies have been found by state inspectors since 2013; 76% belong to for-profit owned facilities.</p> <p>But given that for-profits own the majority of nursing homes across 50 states, I also did a per-capita analysis to make sure that complaints and deficiencies are still filed mostly against for-profit owners. The top 10 states with the highest average of complaints are below. In these 10 states, complaints filed per 1000 residents against for-profit owners are higher than those against non-profit or government owned institutions.</p> <p>Oregon, Nevada and Idaho have the largest difference between complaints filed against the two ownership structures.</p> <br>

</div> <script src="lollipop.bdf43623.js"></script> <div class="story-body"> <br> <p>Studies have shown that for-profit ownership exacerbates poor staffing as corporations are eager to run facilities on a leaner budget. Facilities are understaffed while nurses are underpaid.</p> <p>When nurses aren't able to attend the needs of vulnerable elderly residents, deficient care is the main repercussion. Residents fall, they are not administered proper medicine or they are not given proper care. This is why 40 states have more deficiencies per capita filed against for-profit facilities.</p>
