  <p>For-profit corporations own the majority of nursing home facilities in 44 states. In 2012, public health experts published a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3447240/">study</a> that concluded that the top 10 for-profit chains had less registered nurses and lower total nurse staffing hours than non-profit or government-owned facilities. The chains received 36% higher deficiencies and 41% higher serious deficiencies than government facilities.</p>
  <p>Using data from from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, I was able to analyze complaints and deficiencies per capita filed against for-profit and non-profit-owned facilites in all 50 states. Since nursing homes are increasingly owned by for-profit chains and private equity investors, I scraped the CMS website to get the latest ownership structure for each facility in the country. I used Python (pandas) to clean and analyze the dataset after merging the complaints and deficiencies per facility with my ownership dataset.</p>

  <p>For this per capita analysis, I used census data for each facility during 2017 and 2018, and filtered the deficienices database for the same time frame.</p>
  <p>The top 10 states with the highest number of complaints are below. In these 10 states, complaints filed per 1000 residents against for-profit owners are higher than those against non-profit or government owned institutions.</p>
  <p>California, Maryland and Michigan have the largest difference between complaints filed against the two ownership structures.</p>
